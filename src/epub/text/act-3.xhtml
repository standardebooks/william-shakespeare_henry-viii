									<span>I am a poor fall’n man, unworthy now</span>

									<span>To be thy lord and master: seek the king;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Some little memory of me will stir him⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I know his noble nature⁠—not to let</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Neglect him not; make use now, and provide</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For thine own future safety.</span>

									<span>Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Let’s dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A sure and safe one, though thy master miss’d it.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Mark but my fall, and that that ruin’d me.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Corruption wins not more than honesty.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Let all the ends thou aim’st at be thy country’s,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thy God’s, and truth’s; then if thou fall’st, O Cromwell,</span>

									<span>Thou fall’st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;</span>

									<span>And⁠—prithee, lead me in:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There take an inventory of all I have,</span>

									<span>To the last penny; ’tis the king’s: my robe,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And my integrity to heaven, is all</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Had I but served my God with half the zeal</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I served my king, he would not in mine age</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Have left me naked to mine enemies.</span>
